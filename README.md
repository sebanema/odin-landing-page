# My Website Project

This is a demonstration website that I've built to practice HTML and CSS.

## Description

This website contains various components such as a navigation bar, introduction section, image containers, and a call-to-action section. It is designed with a pc-first approach, although it is fully responsive to different screen sizes. It includes a variety of CSS properties such as Flexbox for layout and structure, and it demonstrates proper HTML semantic structuring.

## Features

- Navigation bar with logo and links
- Introduction section with two-column layout
- Multiple image containers with text descriptions
- Quote block
- Call-to-action section with a sign up button
- Footer

## Installation
